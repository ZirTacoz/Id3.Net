# Id3.Net Tag Library

This is a .Net library for ID3 tag reading from MP3 files.

Forked from https://id3.codeplex.com/

I just care about Id3, Id3.Files projects and Id3 tag decoding in them. Don't expect everything else to work.

## Changes in the Fork:

- Added Shift-JIS encoding detection and decoding
- Fixed bugs in tag decoding
- .Net Standard 2.0 conversion
